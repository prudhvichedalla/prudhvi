మా తెలుగు తల్లికి మల్లెపూదండ
మా కన్నతల్లికి మంగళారతులు,
కడుపులో బంగారు కనుచూపులో కరుణ,
చిరునవ్వులో సిరులు దొరలించు మాతల్లి.

గలగలా గోదారి కదలిపోతుంటేను
బిరాబిరా క్రిష్ణమ్మ పరుగులిడుతుంటేను
బంగారు పంటలే పండుతాయీ
మురిపాల ముత్యాలు దొరులుతాయి.

అమరావతి నగర అపురూప శిల్పాలు
త్యాగయ్య గొంతులో తారాడు నాదాలు
తిక్కయ్య కలములొ తియ్యందనాలు
నిత్యమై నిఖిలమై నిలచి వుండేదాకా

రుద్రమ్మ భుజశక్తి మల్లమ్మ పతిభక్తి
తిమ్మరసు ధీయుక్తి, కృష్ణరాయల కీర్తి
మా చెవులు రింగుమని మారుమ్రోగేదాక
నీపాటలే పాడుతాం, నీ ఆటలే ఆడుతాం
జై తెలుగు తల్లి, జై తెలుగు తల్లి
